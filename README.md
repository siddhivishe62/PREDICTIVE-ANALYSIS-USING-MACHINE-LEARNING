 🚢 Task 2: Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

🎯Objective:
Analyze thebTitanic dataset to build and compare machine learning models for predicting passenger survival.
📚Tools & Technologies
* Python
* Pandas (Data Manipulation)
* Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
📝Task Description
-Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns based on features like gender, age, and passenger class.
-Conducted data cleaning, missing value handling, and feature engineering.
-Built and evaluated machine learning models:
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest Classifier
- Compared model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
📥Dataset Source
The dataset `titanic.csv` (or `train.csv`) is available from Kaggle:
➡️ [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

📊 Key Outcomes
- Gained insights on survival probabilities based on **gender, class, and age group**.
-Developed and compared classification models:
  * Logistic Regression: Simpler, interpretable model.
  * Random Forest: More accurate on this dataset.
- Evaluated models using accuracy and visualized with confusion matrices.
