🚢 Task 2: Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning
🎯 Objective:
Perform predictive data analysis on the Titanic dataset to build and compare machine learning models for predicting passenger survival.
📚 Tools & Technologies
-Python
-Pandas (Data Manipulation)
-Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
-Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
-Dataset: titanic.csv (or train.csv from Kaggle)
📝 Task Description
-Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand relationships between features such as gender, age, class, and survival rate.
-Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and handled missing values.
-Built and evaluated classification models:
*Logistic Regression
*Random Forest Classifier
-Compared the performance of these models using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

📥 Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:
➡️ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)📊 Key Outcomes
-Explored survival rates based on gender, age groups, passenger class, etc.
-Identified key features influencing survival.
-Compared Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest:
-Logistic Regression for interpretability.
-Random Forest for better accuracy on this dataset.

📈 Sample Visualizations
-Survival rate by gender and class.
-Confusion matrix comparisons of models.
